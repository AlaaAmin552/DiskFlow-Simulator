# DiskFlow-Simulator
A simulator for disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SCAN, C-SCAN). Users input the number of cylinders, requests, initial head position, and choose an algorithm. It calculates total head movement and shows the order of cylinder visits. Built in C for educational purposes to optimize disk I/O performance.
